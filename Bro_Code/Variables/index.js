// A variable is a container for storing data
// A variable behaves as if it was the value it contains

// Two steps:
// 1. Declaration (var, let, const)
// 2. Assignment (= assignment operator)

// Declaring variables + displaying value.
let age;
age = 21;
let secondAge = 23;
console.log("Your age is: " + age);
console.log("Your second age is: " + secondAge);

// Incrementing to a variable + displaying value.
let thirdAge = 50;
fourthAge = thirdAge + 1;
console.log("Your fourth age is: " + fourthAge);

// Displaying a series of characters (String).
let firstName = "Ahmed";
let secondName = "Affaan";
console.log("Your name is: " + firstName + " " + secondName);
